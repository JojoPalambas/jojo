You are advised to use this program in three steps:
    * Type 'make' to compile it
    * Type './rt [input] [output]' to execute it
        - [input] should be replaced by the name of the .svati file you want
          to use to generate your .ppm file
        - [output] should be replaced by the name you want to give to your file
    * Type 'make clean' to clean the directory from the .o files and the
      binary file.
