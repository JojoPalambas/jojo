Hardcore Bisounours is a nervous survival (a little bit bit them'up) game.
All you have to do is to navigate between two worlds: A light one with birds,
unicorns and a lot of more lovely things.
On the other hand, the second world is much darker, with monsters that only
want one thing: Eat you.
Get the sword and slain all the monsters to win.
