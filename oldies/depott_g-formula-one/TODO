* Code an advanced braking system to allow the car to go faster

* Re-enable diagonals for Dijkstra's and avoid collisions
    in this kind of turns:  0000000000
                            0000000011
                            0000000110
                            0000001100
                            0000011000
                            0000110000
                            0001100000
                            0011000000

* Simplify the Dijkstra's path from a path of adjacent cells to a path of
    sparated key nodes.
