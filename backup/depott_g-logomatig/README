I have finished exercises 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, the lexer, the parser
and the functions needed to draw the square.

Exercises 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 were very easy to finish.

I have had some minor problems with the Tiger syntax for exercises 2.5 and 2.6.

I have had a lot of huge problems with the lexer, a lot of segfaults and
compilation errors. It took me 7 hours to complete the lexer.

The parser was quite easy and fast to do, despite some compiling errors due to
the fact that ther language was new for me.

The drawing functions were very easy and have been done in about an hour.
