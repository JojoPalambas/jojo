INTRODUCTION
------------

The 42sh is a Shell Command Language interpreter. It operates according to the
following general overview of operations :

The 42sh reads its input from the standard input or from a file (-c option).
The shell breaks the input into tokens: words and operators, parses the input
into commands. The 42sh performs various expansions and redirection, before
executing the command(s) and returning the exit status.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

Berfore using the 42sh we strongly recommand you to:

  * Read the SCL (http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xcu/chap2.html).
  * Be familiar with an UNIX Environment.
  * Know how to use other shells like bash.


RECOMMENDED MODULES
-------------------

  * C Standard Library


INSTALLATION
------------

To facilitate the removal of trashfiles we suggest you to compile as followed:

  * mkdir tmp
    cd tmp
    cmake ..
    make
    ./42sh

  * To create and view Project Documentation:
    make doc
    firefox html/index.html

  * To clean everything:

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The program has no menu or modifiable settings. There is no configuration. When
launched just use it as you would use the BASH.

USAGE
-----

You can use the following options:

    [-c]
         follow the bash behavior for this option. The commands are read from
         the first non option command string.
    [+/-O]
         follow the bash behavior for this option. -O sets the value of that
         option +O unsets it. If shopt_option is not supplied, the names and
         values of the shell options accepted by shopt are printed on the
         standard output.
    [--norc]
         this option deactivates the ressource reader. Does not execute the
         .42shrc
    [--ast-print]
         this option activates the AST printer
    [--version]
         this option prints the current 42sh version on the standard output
         and exits

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

 * The program is not working properly

  - Try to close the program and clear cache.

  - If it still does not work. Reboot your computer. If it still doesn't work
    we suggest you to install bash.

FAQ
---

Q:  I tried to open the PS2, but it does not work, the program segfault
    instantly, is this normal?

A:  Yes, this is the intended behavior. This is very unlikely that any part of
    our program work as you wished. However, anything that do works or looks
    suspicious can be considered as a feature.
