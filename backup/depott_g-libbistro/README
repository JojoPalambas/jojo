For now, I only have:
- BigNum and Base classes that work well but without operators
- A testsuite

I've had a big trouble while trying to compile my testsuite with make,
because all the included files seem to be "forgotten": no error was thrown to
tell me that the included files do not exist, but nothing contained in those
files work if I compile with make.
Therefore, as my Makefile doesn't work, to use the testsuite, write:
    - cd tests
    - g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic testsuite.cc
    - ./a.out
    - rm testsuite
    - cd ..
