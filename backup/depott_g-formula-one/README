    * Running with the testsuite:
        There is a testsuite located in ./tests called test.sh.
        This testsuite runs the program without displaying anything, just to
        count how much time it takes for the car to reach the end of the map.
        The program is run on almost all the maps made by the assistants or
        ourselves.

    * Running by hand:
        First, a temporary file should be created using "cd `mktemp -d`".
        Then, the all the files needed to compile the program should be created
        using "cmake /path/of/the/project/folder".

        Then, several make targets can be used:
            - make formulaone: compiles the program to create the binary file
            - make run: compiles the program and runs it
            - make check: compiles the program and runs it quickly without
                any display, to test the program on a particular map (this is
                what the testsuite does for every map). To use it, you should
                type "make check" and then "./check /path/of/the/map".
